## Processed data in analysis-ready format

- `Processed_data.zip`: A compressed zip file contains the processed data, ready for immediate analysis. It comprises the following files:
  - `ASV_table.tsv`: Amplicon sequencing variantt (ASV) abundance table. The columns are sample names and the rows are ASV names. Generated from [DADA2](https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/index.html) pipeline through [Qiime2](https://qiime2.org/) platform.
  - `Representative_ASV_sequences.fasta`: FASTA format 
  - `Metadata.tsv`: Metadata contains sample information available for analysis, such as sampling time points, sample origin and host sex.
  - `Phylogenetic_tree.nwk`: Newick format phylogenetic tree of ASV, generated by [q2-fragment-insertion](https://library.qiime2.org/plugins/q2-fragment-insertion/16/) plugin in [Qiime2](https://qiime2.org/) platform.
